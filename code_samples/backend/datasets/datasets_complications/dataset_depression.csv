(Don’t judge me, my sister made me feel bad before and my grandma made me overstep my boundaries) I could but I couldn’t smile and pretend that I was fine anymore. Well, I went upstairs, cut myself after fucking 14 months being clean (thanks grandma), went back downstairs, smiled and helped making the salad. My fathers girlfriend later told me that my grandma seeked for conformation from her for forcing me to prepare dinner. She did not give her that. I fucking love that woman."

18386,My sister actually thinks that depression is just a mindset. So basically she’s saying that it’s my fault that I’m sick and it’s my decision to still feel this way. I just don’t WANT to be happyI could just ignore her and don’t care… but I’m already blaming myself and her blaming me as well isn’t quite helping at that point.She just confirms my guilt

18411,I cannot tell what sounds sadder the fact that I think nobody cares or the fact that I cannot believe they care if they’d tell me
18412,Who cares about me anyway HAHAHA
18413,My heart needs to breath
18414,Therapy doesn’t work…YAY
18415,I’m at the hospital for five weeks now and five more weeks are to go. My psychologist is the sweetest doctor i’ve ever met and therapy is…nice.I still wish I were dead
18416,* me trying to open up a little *My brain: “Don’t get to attached. Remember what happend last time.”
18417,Depression kills people.I’m literally dying
18418,I’m so good at hiding my feelings sometimes even forget I have those
18419,I’m going to be okay…                                               …just not today.
18420,💃✨ Just a song for your ana playlist
18421,I really really wanna get a little drunk right now
18422,“Have you tried therapy?” Yes no just shut up and let me be
18423,I cannot let people help me……because I don’t want to see their faces…when they realize that they wasted time                                                  …for nothing
18424,"What I mean when I say “I’m fine”:“Honestly? I feel nothing at all. I’m not feeling guilty, sad, depressed, anxious or lonely. Maybe a bit irritated because i should feel something, anything. I still wish I were dead but I’m not going to kill myself - at least not today. Besides that I have those regular lacks of motivation, energy, physical strenght, appetite and will to live and that way too fast heart beat, headache, backache, flashbacks, panic attacks all those other tiny symptoms I forgot about because I’m way to used to live with them. Sometimes I wish I could tell you how ""feeling nothing” feels like but I’m too scared. I’m scared that you might think I’m too complicated if I open up to you, sooo don’t worry, I won’t do that. I’m used to those thoughts too. Seriously I want to cry but there is nothing I feel so nothing to cry about. Sucks sometimes but it also makes my daily existence so much easier. I needed to say this but I don’t want you to worry or try something to help my. You, not leaving me even if I’m complicated is the biggest help you could possibly give me.“"
18425,"Everybody tells me I need to heal……and I get that. Really, i do. But noone can tell me how I’m supposed to do so"
18426,Why heal?? If you could just make up a mask and pretend like you are okay :D
18427,It’s my birthday. When I blew the candles earlier this morning I wished for a truck to mash up my brain. (I’m joking - there were no candles to blow out) Keep your fingers crossed. 🤞🏼
18428,I know i didn’t do nothing wrong…                                         …but in the end…                                                    …it’s always my fault.
18429,I feel lonely                             and empty._.
18430,"Quick thought: People wearing red ana bracelets aren’t “pro anorexia” or pro death or pro mental illness. They are pro community, pro support, pro compliments, pro validation, pro beauty (even though beauty is something that can be discussed)"
18431,How can existing be so damn exhausting D:
18432,It’s 3 a.m. and I’m afraid to sleep. The thought of dreaming is making me so anxious that I’m not tired anyway…I can’t stand another nightmare this week D:
18433,"I’m back at the hospital. ✌🏼Nothing happend. This was planned and I waited for this day to come since June. I’m trying CBASP, a therapy for chronically depressed adults. Wish me luck 🤞🏼 because I cannot see any more options."
18434,"He hurt me. * Surprise a guy hurt a girl * But wait! He didn’t break my heart in pieces. He touched my body where I only wanted to be touched by love. That’s not even the problem. I could deal with that. What I cannot deal with is that I never said “No”. I freezed and cried but I never said “No, get your disgusting hands of me and get the fuck out of my house!” That’s worse."
18435,"The Japanese say you have three faces. The first face, you show to the world. The second face, you show to your close friends and your family. The third face, you never show anyone."
18436,I used to see spiders when I closed my eyes - it was a nightmare.Now I see you when I close my eyes.I wish I could get back those spiders…I’m afraid of closing my eyes
18437,i’m hurtHe promised to never hurt me. Not on purpose - but what does it matter?i’m still hurt. He apologized at least a hundred times - but what does it matter?i’m still hurt.
18438,I am not depressed. I am Depression.: )
18439,I’m annoyingly restless but also exhausted.I cannot stand up but I cannot sleep either
18440,"I don’t get it. I ate a lot, daily and regular the last six months and my body gained weight because it was in it’s emergency mode. It took a while but it understood that I will also eat the next day and the next week and stopped storing fat. But nowI haven’t eaten regularly in days now and I lost…0.3 kg (i.e. I had a third of a banana today (@1am) and won’t eat again until tonight)0.3 kg! This is nothing - it cannot even be called weight loss.  LOL  My body is back in emergency mode for absolutly no reason."
18441,"I was lowkey confused. I gained weight and appetite because of my medication. I ate so much I almost thought my disordered eating habits were gone or I never had them. I stopped taking my meds and I’m back to normal again. 🫣 HeheI had a few walnuts, an orange juice and a gum today. My body thinks that’s enough. And honestly I’m okay with that. It sucks that I’m also back to…feelin’ sick when I don’t eat, not eating because I feel sick, feeling sick by the smell of fat and food in general, being annoyed because I’m not done eating after a glas of water, forgetting to eat at all, deciding between alcohol and food daily and being disgusted by eating people…though. 😊"
18442,"I just told my only and best friend of six years friendship that I do not longer wish to be friends. She was kinda nice but also accepted it very fast. I think this was one of those Run-away-and-hope-someone-comes-after-you-scenarios. Okay no, not really. Gives me the feeling that she doesn’t care anyway."
18443,"I had breakfast this morning and was like “Nice, I ate something healthy and not too much of it. Maybe I can actually develop healthy eating habits.”Now I’m like “Ohgod, I wanna starve the next five days.”"
18444,I’m a depressed eating disordered.I struggle to eat and I struggle to not eat at the same timeMake it make sense
18445,I’m playing with the thought to end my only friendship. I’ve known her since 8th grade (6 years) and we have been through a lot. She’s a pretty damaged person and regularly gave me headache. I used to wonder why we are friends but I stopped a few years ago because our friendship developed in a kind of way I thought I like. Therapy helped me to see that I let myself be used by others especially by her. I easily tend to give more than I get back and I was fine with that for years. I think I could go on like that and still be fine with that but I think I shouldn’t be.
18446,"Yes, I survived it but I still have to live with the trauma…By the way - Yungblud released a new album a few weeks ago and that’s one of the songs. Enjoy (TW suicide-thoughts)"
18447,"Do you believe in an after-life? What if this kind of pain is endless and there is a life..after life..after life…after life…I really really hope there’s not and being dead is like deep sleep - without nightmares, dreams, talking or sleep walking - and forever obviously."
18448,I feel much better today! :) Still wish I were dead tho
18449,I’m sick of this. I’m sick of medication because fake motivation won’t make me wanna live. They feel good as long as they do something nice but this only makes the dark times even darker because you now know how normal people feel every day but you also know that medication will never be capable of giving you that.I’m sick of family and friends because I’ll never be able to trust.I’m sick of therapy because I’m sick of talking about myself because talking about myself never ever helps.I’m sick of fighting because life still isn’t worth it.I’m so sick…it might even be depression.Don’t get me wrong - this is not me calling for help. I’m past that. This is me dying.
18450,Fuck talking about itFuck skillsFuck therapyFuck medicationFuck self-harm Fuck crying Fuck livingFUCK ALL OF THIS! It’s pointless. Everything is just pointless.I can’t do this anymore…You wanted me to try it and to fight for it and I did even though I knew it could break me. I’m tired now……please just let me sleep.
18451,AAHHHHHHHHH! CAN SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE THIS STOP?! I can’t keep doing this…

18453,"The funny thing is, when you don’t let people disrespect you, they start calling you difficult. ~ Tom Hardy"
18454,My heart is frozen and my hands are cold. I’m longing for the fire that burns in you but everything i touch freezes to deathand I remain freezing and cold like a corpse.
18455,What doesn’t kill you fucks you up mentally.
18456,I don’t know what I’m doing.Do you?
18457,"“I’m insecure what to say to you.” and “I don’t want to lose you.” was what he said after I ended our friendship because he sexually abused me. Everytime I hear “I’m insecure” and “I don’t want to lose you.” I get blinded by rage again and want to scream, cry, run and… I don’t know. I wish I could simply banish those memories from my mind."
18458,I don’t want your forgiveness but I’d love to explain myself…I just want to let you know that I didn’t leave because you did something… I left because I’m afraid of getting hurt when you lose interest. So I break things before they can break on their own.…I want you to know that I did this because of me not because of you.
18459,I feel guilty because I have depression and a dog. My depression is severe and chronic and my dog is the one suffering because of it. I told that my therapist and she said: “You said you’re a horrible dog owner but I see a girl who is trying her best every day.”That’s nice to hear but what is the good about trying-your-best if “your best” just isn’t good enough? I don’t think I’m a horrible dog owner because my dog was only outside for an hour instead of three. I think I’m a horrible dog owner because I know my dog would be better off with someone else. But I can’t give her away…
18460,"I found a walking red flag.                                                                          He’s mentally ill. His problems are depression, loneliness, psychosis, paranoia, obsessions…as far as I know. There is probably more.                He’s craving for any kind of relationship preferable  including sex and excluding love. He’s oversharing private things. I know if we’d get involved in any kind of way…he will make sure everyone knows about it.                                       He thinks he likes me but it’s the attention not me. ✨                                               How do I know? I’m not completely different. But I know I only love his attention not him and I will not be devasted if our - whatever - ends. In fact I already know that I will be the one ending this thing."
18461,"I’m so passive agressive that I actually feel sorry for those who surround me. Oh great, now I feel agressive AND guilty. Lovely."

I’m sorry if I’m repeating myself. I just want to make sure you get what I say. What I mean is…I don’t want to live. I never did. That probably means I want to die… doesn’t it?I’m sorry too.
18463,If you don’t want to eat even though you are hungry…just watch this video and remind yourself that you never ever want to be like him. You’re Welcome 🙂🥲🤮
18464,"I used to lie in the garden every night and just watch the stars, the moon and the clouds existing, wandering and blinking. A few nights a friend crashed on my couch and I took him with me in the garden every night. A few drinks and a sexual harassment later I cutted him out of life together with my every-night-ritual. The moral of the story? Don’t share important things with people. They might destroy it."

18469,Mood ♥
18470,Part of the path.
18471,Latest report on what it sounds like down in the woods right now. Sadly did not pick up the Swainson’s thrush or the yellow-billed cuckoo among others who were singing earlier. Black locusts are blooming so the cedar waxwings are busy nipping the backs of the flowers for nectar. In places the path was littered with blossoms. It was lovely.
18472,I picked up that tulip poplar blossom from the forest floor and put it on the old bridge so you could see all of this at once.
18473,Another rainy gray day when I hoped to go out for sunrise so here’s a sunrise from earlier in May. Is this the cloudiest spring ever or is it just bad timing again and again?
18474,Bridget and the Saintpaulias for Caturday.
18475,The process of planting the front porch flowers has begun.
18476,Off topic but today I stopped at the park in Kutztown to see the Keith Haring sculpture Figure Balancing on Dog. Haring grew up not far from where I take a lot of my pictures.
18477,"Another 15th of May, down in the woods outside town. Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight!"
18478,"May doing its green magic, 2019. A month later you would hardly be able to see the lake from that spot."
18479,"3 years ago today I visited some cliffs along the Lehigh River. Water seeped and dripped from them constantly and the were covered with a wonderful mix of mosses, lichens, liverworts and other native plants."
18480,While I’m posting from the camera here are a few of a bluebird couple at the park last week. There’s a nest box on a pole along that fence and they were hanging out near it.
18481,"Female hummingbird. A male has been coming for about a week (males arrive early to establish territories, females arrive later when food sources are more reliable) but only when it’s dark, way before sunrise or well after sunset. This is the first female I’ve seen this season and this was early morning too but with just enough light for my camera.  Welcome back, smol friend!"
18482,"It doesn’t look like much right now but the handsome green dragon in the garden has finally wakened from sleep. I bought a companion so maybe one could pollinate the other and I could finally get seeds but while it was out on the patio in a plastic pot waiting to be planted, squirrels sheered the new one off at ground level. :-/"
18483,Foggy sunrise at the lake last Tuesday.
18484,A yesterday thing that wasn’t aurora related: buttercups by the stream.
18485,"ohnopicturesofanothercat:Once again Bridget is exceeding legal cuteness limits. And these were preceded by her master move of squirming so her head is upside-down looking at you wide-eyed with her toe beans showing. I just couldn’t get the phone ready fast enough.
Bridget for Caturday"
18486,"A note to people who may be looking for aurora the next couple nights: even if it looks cloudy where you are, take a couple phone pictures of the sky to the north to make sure. When I got up I thought it was cloudy. Luckily I took a couple phone pictures and they picked up the colors. It turned out that what I *thought* were clouds were the pillars and curtains of the aurora. The lights here in town had made it difficult for me to see the colors so the aurora looked gray like clouds to my naked eyes. I almost went back to sleep!"
18487,Also I could see a fogbow from my house because why not?For @srobrien2
18488,The Big Dipper set in aurora colors.We don’t usually have aurora. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen it!

18491,Morning of the 7th of May.
18492,View from a bridge.
18493,I have some things from Tuesday that I meant to post. It was a beautiful morning.[Edit: I removed the video because it turns out I had already posted it.]
18494,I was lucky enough to see a veery in the woods while walking with @alackofcharacter yesterday. They’re one of my favorite woodland thrushes with a magical voice that seems to spiral downward. This one stood still long enough to let me get a clear shot. That hardly ever happens! The little wood near my house hosts at least one breeding pair every summer.
18495,"dduane:Yay, the lilacs are coming out!
Lovely!"
18496,Oak tree in the park at sunrise.
18497,Scarlet tanagers are red enough to begin with but when you see them in that first sunrise light they look like they’re lit from within.
18498,Good morning!
18499,"Not a good picture I know but I’m just posting it to point out that on the day after a significant birthday on my part nature and the world chose to show me a coot. I couldn’t tell if it was an old one but still, rude!"
18500,"Black haw in bloom, Viburnum prunifolium, small native tree."

18510,"“All that a man has to say or do that can possibly concern mankind, is in some shape or other to tell the story of his love,—to sing; and, if he is fortunate and keeps alive, he will be forever in love. This alone is to be alive to the extremities.”—Henry David Thoreau"
18511,"Woodland stream with two-leaf miterwort, 6th of May 2019."

18516,The auriculas. I just think they’re so cool.
18517,"The lilacs are all but finished but a new sweetness is in the air, lily of the valley. And don’t worry, when I bring it in I put it where Bridget can’t reach it! I know it’s poisonous."
18518,Detail from the back garden. Someday I may trim it and organize it but today was not that day. It does so many great things on its own!
18519,"Jack in the pulpit, Arisaema triphyllum. It always feels like running into a little plant guy when I see him. I say hello."
18520,"I’m not usually good at phalaenopsis but this one, called Chingruey’s Goldstaff, rebloomed for me this year! It’s small but has a beautiful fragrance."
18521,"Wood thrush having a drink in the woods this morning, wetting its pipes before making the wood magical with its song."
18522,"Hosta ‘June’, a star of the garden."
18523,"And just like that, aided by last night’s thunderstorm, early spring with its flowering cherries and apples is about over and the greening begins in earnest. Happy May!"
18524,"Happy May Day and Beltane to all who celebrate! When I was very young my mother got me to get up very early on the first of May, make some paper cones,  fill them with fresh picked flowers then lay them on the neighbors’ front steps. It was one of my favorite holidays."
18525,"Apple blossoms, taken Friday morning before this heat wave."
18526,Another video with wood thrush and other bird song. I hesitated to post this because at the end there’s some construction noise but that’s the reality of eastern Pennsylvania. It’s all the more remarkable that birds are singing when houses are being built barely 100 feet away.
18527,"A mossy log along the trail yesterday, then a woodland view, with bird soundtrack.For @pardonkedim if you’re still out there."
18528,"I took so many pictures on my walk today and I’ll never get to all of them so here are a few selected  favorites, from sunrise at the start to a tulip when I returned home."
18529,I don’t know what causes this beech tree to have little branches and leaves all the way up its trunk. Usually beech tree trunks are smooth.
18530,I got to the dog park before the dogs.
18531,This but with wood thrushes singing. And I’m the only journalist on the ground with this breaking news.
18533,"And now suddenly the swifts are back and chattering overhead whenever I step outside, as if we’re on a floating island that’s been sailing south for weeks and have suddenly reached the place where it’s always summer."

18543,"Same oak tree, February and April, winter into spring."
18544,I’m not sure this will post. It’s pretty long. But wood thrushes and bells with other birds added— I had to try!
18545,"Oh no, not another morning. How will our hero cope?"
18546,"Four primroses blooming in containers right now: the red ones, first and fourth, are Primula eliator ‘Gold Lace’ aka bumblebee primrose and the other two which I grew from seed started in 2020 are Primula auricula, an alpine species. I feel like I could so easily become completely obsessed with growing as many kinds of these as possible. They are, as I’ve heard said of some kinds of food, more-ish!"
18547,Detail from a walk. Maybe I’m losing it but everything looked so lovely yesterday.
18548,Little garden area at my favorite place in town. That’s a weeping apple tree (I think the only one I’ve ever seen) and will be covered with bloom by next week but even now this looks so cottagecore.

18560,"Mother Earth SeasonEarth Day is tomorrow so here is my annual post. It’s long but I mean it with all my heart.Everything we are, everything we own, everything that makes up our family, our lovers, our pets, our houses, ships at sea, planes in the air, shopping centers, factories, cities, computers, and, of course, all of the diversity and glory of nature, comes from the Earth. We have Earth Day, when we talk about problems with the Earth and try to fix them, but it’s time for us to celebrate the beauty, glory, and nurturing of the Earth and show our thanks for this source of everything.Let’s celebrate the time between Earth Day and the day the U.S. celebrates as Mothers Day as Mother Earth Season, a time to look at, appreciate, and celebrate everything wonderful and amazing about the earth and the living things on it.Find wonderful things in nature and show them to other people. Take an older person out of the nursing home for a picnic or a drive through the woods. Tell children stories of remarkable and beautiful places, animals, plants, or events in nature that you saw before they were born. Give nature parties, play nature-related music, dance, paint pictures, write poems, share photographs about nature and, most of all, take walks. Get up early to see the sunrise light on everything and take pictures, or not, find out when and where to see the Pleiades rise and set. Look at the landscape from hills, take paths along streams and into glens. Sit in a beautiful place with someone you love or sit and remember deeply someone you loved. Take it all in and share it with others!Most of all, take time to feel happy to be alive on this beautiful earth and let yourself feel wonder.Feel the joy of being on this living planet. Tell the Earth how amazing she is and that you’re glad she’s given you this time here. If these were your last days, what would you want to say to this, your home and source that gave you everything you’ve ever known, including your self? As Mister Eckhart said, “If the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough.”And as Rumi is quoted, “Let the beauty we love be what we do. There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.”"
