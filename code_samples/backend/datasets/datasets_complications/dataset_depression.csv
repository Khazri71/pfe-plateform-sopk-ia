3309,"@sapphirespecter @KatyElphinstone Yeah, that's kinda where I was a few years back. Most people who have dysthymia (aka 'chronic depression') aren't consciously aware of it IME because it's not Active Crushing Sadness like Major Depression (the thing most people mean by 'depression')."

This is the first female I‚Äôve seen this season and this was early morning too but with just enough light for my camera.  Welcome back, smol friend!"
18482,"It doesn‚Äôt look like much right now but the handsome green dragon in the garden has finally wakened from sleep. I bought a companion so maybe one could pollinate the other and I could finally get seeds but while it was out on the patio in a plastic pot waiting to be planted, squirrels sheered the new one off at ground level. :-/"
18483,Foggy sunrise at the lake last Tuesday.
18484,A yesterday thing that wasn‚Äôt aurora related: buttercups by the stream.
18485,"ohnopicturesofanothercat:Once again Bridget is exceeding legal cuteness limits. And these were preceded by her master move of squirming so her head is upside-down looking at you wide-eyed with her toe beans showing. I just couldn‚Äôt get the phone ready fast enough.
Bridget for Caturday"
18486,"A note to people who may be looking for aurora the next couple nights: even if it looks cloudy where you are, take a couple phone pictures of the sky to the north to make sure. When I got up I thought it was cloudy. Luckily I took a couple phone pictures and they picked up the colors. It turned out that what I *thought* were clouds were the pillars and curtains of the aurora. The lights here in town had made it difficult for me to see the colors so the aurora looked gray like clouds to my naked eyes. I almost went back to sleep!"
18487,Also I could see a fogbow from my house because why not?For @srobrien2
18488,The Big Dipper set in aurora colors.We don‚Äôt usually have aurora. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ever seen it!

18493,I have some things from Tuesday that I meant to post. It was a beautiful morning.[Edit: I removed the video because it turns out I had already posted it.]
18494,I was lucky enough to see a veery in the woods while walking with @alackofcharacter yesterday. They‚Äôre one of my favorite woodland thrushes with a magical voice that seems to spiral downward. This one stood still long enough to let me get a clear shot. That hardly ever happens! The little wood near my house hosts at least one breeding pair every summer.

Lovely!"
18496,Oak tree in the park at sunrise.

18499,"Not a good picture I know but I‚Äôm just posting it to point out that on the day after a significant birthday on my part nature and the world chose to show me a coot. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was an old one but still, rude!"
18500,"Black haw in bloom, Viburnum prunifolium, small native tree."
18501,"At the long pond along the ridge, spring greens and bird song. Frogs too, I think. Sunny spring mornings are the best."

18518,Detail from the back garden. Someday I may trim it and organize it but today was not that day. It does so many great things on its own!
18519,"Jack in the pulpit, Arisaema triphyllum. It always feels like running into a little plant guy when I see him. I say hello."
18520,"I‚Äôm not usually good at phalaenopsis but this one, called Chingruey‚Äôs Goldstaff, rebloomed for me this year! It‚Äôs small but has a beautiful fragrance."
18521,"Wood thrush having a drink in the woods this morning, wetting its pipes before making the wood magical with its song."
18522,"Hosta ‚ÄòJune‚Äô, a star of the garden."
18523,"And just like that, aided by last night‚Äôs thunderstorm, early spring with its flowering cherries and apples is about over and the greening begins in earnest. Happy May!"

18525,"Apple blossoms, taken Friday morning before this heat wave."
18526,Another video with wood thrush and other bird song. I hesitated to post this because at the end there‚Äôs some construction noise but that‚Äôs the reality of eastern Pennsylvania. It‚Äôs all the more remarkable that birds are singing when houses are being built barely 100 feet away.
18527,"A mossy log along the trail yesterday, then a woodland view, with bird soundtrack.For @pardonkedim if you‚Äôre still out there."

18530,I got to the dog park before the dogs.
18531,This but with wood thrushes singing. And I‚Äôm the only journalist on the ground with this breaking news.

I feel like I could so easily become completely obsessed with growing as many kinds of these as possible. They are, as I‚Äôve heard said of some kinds of food, more-ish!"
18547,Detail from a walk. Maybe I‚Äôm losing it but everything looked so lovely yesterday.
18548,Little garden area at my favorite place in town. That‚Äôs a weeping apple tree (I think the only one I‚Äôve ever seen) and will be covered with bloom by next week but even now this looks so cottagecore.
18549,"drchucktingle:sun giftVERY EXCITED FOR TODAY. this sun has trotted up again and given us another chance to prove love. CANT WAIT TO GET OUT THERE AND TAKE THIS CHANCE. WHAT A GIFT. LETS TROT

18560,"Mother Earth SeasonEarth Day is tomorrow so here is my annual post. It‚Äôs long but I mean it with all my heart.Everything we are, everything we own, everything that makes up our family, our lovers, our pets, our houses, ships at sea, planes in the air, shopping centers, factories, cities, computers, and, of course, all of the diversity and glory of nature, comes from the Earth. We have Earth Day, when we talk about problems with the Earth and try to fix them, but it‚Äôs time for us to celebrate the beauty, glory, and nurturing of the Earth and show our thanks for this source of everything.Let‚Äôs celebrate the time between Earth Day and the day the U.S. celebrates as Mothers Day as Mother Earth Season, a time to look at, appreciate, and celebrate everything wonderful and amazing about the earth and the living things on it.Find wonderful things in nature and show them to other people. Take an older person out of the nursing home for a picnic or a drive through the woods. Tell children stories of remarkable and beautiful places, animals, plants, or events in nature that you saw before they were born. Give nature parties, play nature-related music, dance, paint pictures, write poems, share photographs about nature and, most of all, take walks. Get up early to see the sunrise light on everything and take pictures, or not, find out when and where to see the Pleiades rise and set. Look at the landscape from hills, take paths along streams and into glens. Sit in a beautiful place with someone you love or sit and remember deeply someone you loved. Take it all in and share it with others!Most of all, take time to feel happy to be alive on this beautiful earth and let yourself feel wonder.Feel the joy of being on this living planet. Tell the Earth how amazing she is and that you‚Äôre glad she‚Äôs given you this time here. If these were your last days, what would you want to say to this, your home and source that gave you everything you‚Äôve ever known, including your self? As Mister Eckhart said, ‚ÄúIf the only prayer you ever say in your entire life is thank you, it will be enough.‚ÄùAnd as Rumi is quoted, ‚ÄúLet the beauty we love be what we do. There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.‚Äù"
